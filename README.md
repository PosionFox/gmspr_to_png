Hello, this a quick project i made to mass convert .gmspr files to .png.

Thanks to YellowAfterLife for indirectly helping me with their code lol.

# How to convert:

### step 1: run the .exe and hit convert (you want your .gmspr files on the same folder as the .exe).
### step 2: wait until it finishes converting.
### step 3: run the .bat file to convert the extensions to .png.
### step 4: locate your files at %localappdata%/gmspr_to_png
### step 5: enjoy.
